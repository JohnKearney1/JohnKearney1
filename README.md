## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm John! 

I'm building out [pITM](https://github.com/JohnKearney1/pITM)!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on... Fiduciary tools (mainly Python) and UI/UX Design (JavaScript flavors).   
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... Python, React, Node, and IPFS systems for distributed networking systems!

All of my repositories function of four basic premises:
1. Freedom to use programs for any purpose
2. Freedom to study and change programs for any purpose
3. Freedom to copy and redistribute
4. Freedom to improve and release modifications
